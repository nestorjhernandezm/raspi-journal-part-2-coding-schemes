% Abstract (Do not use inserted blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{Deploying a large-scale and configurable testbed for
  networking and storage can be challenging, not only due to the
  inherent costs of the hardware, but due to maintenance challenges
  and ability to replicate results consistently. The latter requires
  not only the devices to run the same \ac{OS}, but also
  have exactly the same configurations and software packages. This
  paper presents the design, step-by-step setup, and configuration of
  an inexpensive testbed using Raspberry Pi devices for networking
  (wireless or wired) and storage applications, although the
  architecture can be used for other applications that require
  replicable results.  Specifically, we provide an in-depth
  performance evaluation for network coding, a new paradigm in
  networking and storage, and present the processing
  capabilities and energy behaviour of various code constructions and
  algorithms over different Raspberry Pi models. Our results show that
  processing speeds of more than 80 Mbps and 800 Mbps are attainable
  for a wide array of configurations for the Raspberry Pi Model 1 and
  2, respectively, and that processing energy per bit for network
  coding is below 1 nJ in a large regime and even an order of
  magnitude lower for some algorithms.}

% A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without headings: 1) Background: Place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; 2) Methods: Describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; 3) Results: Summarize the article's main findings; and 4) Conclusion: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article: it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions.

% Keywords
\keyword{Network Coding; Raspberry Pi; Testbed; C++}

% keyword 1; keyword 2; keyword 3. List three to ten pertinent keywords specific to the article, yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.
